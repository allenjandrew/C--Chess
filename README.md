## Overview

**Project Title**: C++ Chess

**Project Description**:

A simple chess game in the terminal. Enter one move at a time and the board will update.

**Project Goals**:

The program needs to be able to handle piece creation and deletion; also needs to demonstrate basic C++ skills using conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and STL data structures.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open terminal and run the following commands:
   - `export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH`
   - `clang++ {filename}.cpp -o {filename}`
   - `./{filename}`

Instructions for using the software:

1. Starting with white, players take turns entering moves
   - Moves are entered in standard chess notation
2. Continue until the game is over!

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- C++
- I use VS Code for my IDE
